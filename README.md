# Class Informer
IDA Class Informer plugin for IDA Pro 9 and older versions.

 - This plugin has been tested with IDA Pro `9.0 Beta`, `7.7` and `8.3`, both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
 - You no longer need a separate version of the plugin for working on 32-bit files in 64-bit IDA.
 - For IDA 9, you just need to install `ClassInformer64.dll`.
 - For IDA 8 and 7, you need to install both `ClassInformer64.dll` and `ClassInformer.dll`.

## Download
- You can download compiled binaries from the [Releases](../../releases) section.
