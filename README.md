# Class Informer
IDA Class Informer plugin for IDA Pro 9 and older versions.

 - This plugin has been tested with IDA Pro `9.0`, and `8.4 SP2`, on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
   - IMPORTANT!!! IDA Pro 9.0 ***beta*** is NOT supported. Use released versions.
 - You no longer need a separate version of the plugin for working on 32-bit files in 64-bit IDA from v2.9.
 - For IDA 9, you just need to install `ClassInformer64.dll`.
 - For IDA 8, you need to install both `ClassInformer_IDA8x64.dll` and `ClassInformer_IDA8x.dll`.
 - If you have both IDA 8 and 9 on your machine, copy them to the IDA's directories according to the versions, or copy all dlls into `%IDAUSR%\plugins`.
