# classinformer-ida8
IDA Class Informer plugin for IDA 8.x
If you want to use this in IDA 9.x and later, use [Class Informer by rohitab](https://github.com/rohitab/ClassInformer).  
I will not maintain this anymore because of the plugin above.

Changelog from the original [IDA ClassInformer PlugIn v2.6](https://sourceforge.net/projects/classinformer/)
- Updated to IDA SDK 8.2 and MSVC 2019
- Updated the plugin form to the new one to work with IDA SDK 8.2
- Created a plugin to analyze PE32 on IDA 64 (IDA_ClassInformer_PlugIn3264.dlL) because IDA is currently stopping to use IDA for 32-bit.
- Linked VC++ runtime statically (/MT*)

## Download
- You can download compiled binaries from the [Releases](../../releases) section.
